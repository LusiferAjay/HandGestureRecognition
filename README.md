# HandGestureRecognition
From this project hand gestures can be ecognised using Python and OpenCV. this project gives exposure about Background Subtraction, Thresholding, Segmentation, Contour Extraction, Convex Hull and Bitwise-AND operation on real-time video sequence
# Dependencies
1.OpenCv
2.convex Hull
3.Image Segmentation
It still can be improved because it depends on various aspect as strength of lightetc.
